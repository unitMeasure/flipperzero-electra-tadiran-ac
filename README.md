## Midea AC Remote

Midea Electric AC remote control for Flipper Zero.

`RG10B10(B)/BGEF`.

Based on [Mitsubishi AC Remote](https://github.com/achistyakov/flipperzero-mitsubishi-ac-remote) code by [@achistyakov](https://github.com/achistyakov).

Protocol description [here](./lib/hvac_midea/README.md).
